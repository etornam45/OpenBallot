# OpenBallot: Decentralized Voting for Clear Governance

## 1. Problem Statement
Traditional voting systems face significant challenges that undermine democracy and transparency. OpenBallot is designed to solve these issues through blockchain-based voting, ensuring security, anonymity, and fraud prevention. The main challenges addressed include:

- **Voter Impersonation:** Preventing fraudulent or duplicate votes.
- **Privacy Risks:** Ensuring that ballots remain anonymous and unlinkable to voters.
- **Lack of Transparency:** Making election processes verifiable and immutable.
- **Vote Manipulation:** Preventing unauthorized modifications to election parameters.

OpenBallot incorporates **Merkle tree validation, zero-knowledge proofs (zk-proofs), and AI-driven facial biometrics** to create a robust voting system that is secure, transparent, and resistant to fraud.

## 2. How OpenBallot Works

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Voter Registration & Verification**
   - User enters their Voter ID.
   - The Voter ID is cryptographically *hashed* and stored in a *Merkle tree*.
   - A *zk-proof* is generated to verify eligibility without revealing personal details.
   
2. **Biometric Authentication**
   - The user undergoes *facial recognition* with *liveness detection* to prevent spoofing.
   - AI-driven anti-spoofing detects deepfakes, masks, and static images.

3. **Access to Voting Dashboard**
   - Once validated, the user accesses the dashboard.
   - They can view available elections and select candidates for *presidential* and *parliamentary* races.

4. **Vote Casting & Validation**
   - The user selects candidates and confirms their choice.
   - A *final facial recognition check* ensures the vote is cast by the right voter.
   - The vote is submitted as an *anonymous blockchain transaction*.
   
5. **Immutable & Transparent Record-Keeping**
   - Votes are recorded on-chain, ensuring they are *tamper-proof* and *verifiable*.
   - Election rules and candidate lists are locked before voting starts and cannot be changed.
   - Smart contracts ensure that *one voter = one vote* and prevent duplicate voting.

6. **Post-Vote Process & Live Results**
   - Once the vote has been cast, the *dashboard is disabled*, preventing further interactions.
   - The user is redirected to a *live results page*, where they can monitor election updates.
   - A *check indicator* is displayed to confirm that their vote has been successfully submitted.

## 3. Tech Stack & Implementation (React + TypeScript + Vite)

### Frontend Development
OpenBallot's frontend is built with **React** and **TypeScript**, using **Vite** for fast performance and modern development workflows.
- ESLint is configured for code quality, with `@vitejs/plugin-react` for fast refresh capabilities.

### ESLint Configuration
For better TypeScript integration, ESLint is extended to include:

```ts
export default tseslint.config({
  extends: [
    ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
    ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
    ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
  ],
  languageOptions: {
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

### Additional Linting Enhancements
To ensure React-specific linting best practices, plugins such as `eslint-plugin-react-x` and `eslint-plugin-react-dom` are used:

```ts
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x';
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom';

export default tseslint.config({
  plugins: {
    'react-x': reactX,
    'react-dom': reactDom,
  },
  rules: {
    ...reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'].rules,
    ...reactDom.configs.recommended.rules,
  },
})
```


## Conclusion
OpenBallot is a next-generation voting system that ensures security, anonymity, and integrity in elections. With a combination of **blockchain, zk-proofs, Merkle trees, and biometric authentication**, it provides a robust and trustworthy platform suitable for governments, organizations, and institutions worldwide.
